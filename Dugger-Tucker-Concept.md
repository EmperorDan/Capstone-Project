# DUGGER TUCKER

## Introduction

Dugger Tucker is about a man named Tucker. It starts off with him sitting on his sofa, watching TV. His show then gets interrupted by an emergency message declaring the world is ending. He runs to the basement and barricades himself within. 
After waiting in his basements for a couple weeks and expending his supplies, he’s forced to leave. Upon trying to exit his basement he realises something is blocking the hatch, and that he’s trapped. Looking around the room he spots his Grampa’s shovel, and has a terrible idea.

-	Survivors are likely to give you items, or even aid you in fights in their respective zone.

-	The player is prompted to pick a direction, shown how to dig, and starts digging.
-	Blocks take about 1 second to destroy.

-	There will be two basements that will be encountered when digging has started. They will consist of:
  -	Basement-01: This basement will introduce the combat mechanic. Upon entering the player will be met with a Psychopath. A Pipe will fall from the roof and the player will be told to pick it up. The Pipe will automatically equip and a dialogue box, displaying the combat controls, will pop up. After killing the Psychopath your sanity bar will decrease by 25%.  
    - Melee Combat: Start with a basic up/down hitting animation. There will be various combat techniques depending on your weapon.
  -	Basement-02: This basement will introduce the health and sanity bar. Upon entering the player will see a Med kit and a comic. The player will be prompted to pick both of these items up. After picking them up a dialogue box explaining their use will appear.
